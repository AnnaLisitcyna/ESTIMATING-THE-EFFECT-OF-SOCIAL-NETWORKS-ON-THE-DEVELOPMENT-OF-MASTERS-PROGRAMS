# Estimating the effect of social networks on the development of Masters' programs
This research is devoted to the study of data from groups of GSOM applicants in the social media Vkontakte with the help of Machine Learning algorithms. The information posted in three groups (undergraduate applicants, graduate applicants and the official GSOM group) and on subscribers' pages was analysed. The data used in the study was obtained from VK API. The following data analysis methods were used: natural language processing, sentiment analysis, regression and binary classification models, and cluster analysis. Additionally, a dashboard in Yandex.DataLens was built to visualise and monitor subscriber data. The analysis revealed that, compared to the other factors, the most important for engagement was the content of the posts. We discovered “trigger” words that have an impact on user activity in GSOM communities. The subscriber segments were also identified on the basis of socio-demographic indicators and the analysis of their interests was conducted.
